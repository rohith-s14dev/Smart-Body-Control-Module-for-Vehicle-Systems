Smart Body Control Module for Vehicle Systems.

Introduction:

This project showcases the development of a Body Control Module (BCM) utilizing CAN (Controller Area Network) communication with ARM microcontrollers. The BCM manages the operation of the left and right turn signals as well as the windshield wiper system in the automobile. This setup consists of a network of four nodes, with one node functioning as the transmitter and the other three nodes serving as receivers.

System Overview:

1.Establish CAN communication among the nodes. 

2.Send and receive data frames through the CAN protocol.

3.Operate the vehicle's indicators and wipers in response to CAN messages.

4.Present pertinent information through UART and LCD screens.

Implementation:

Node A (Transmitter): Tracks the status of the switches and transmits CAN messages to the receiver nodes.  

Node B (Receiver): Operates the right indicator according to the received CAN messages.  

Node C (Receiver): Operates the left indicator based on the received CAN messages.  

Node D (Receiver): Manages the wiper functionality using the received CAN messages.  

Steps to be Followed:

Step 1: Set Up the Hardware  

Assemble the Nodes:  
-> Attach CAN transceivers to each ARM microcontroller development board.  
-> Connect switches to the transmitter node (Node A).  
-> Connect LEDs to Node B and Node C for the right and left indicators, respectively.  
-> Attach a motor or servo to Node D for controlling the wiper.  
-> Connect an LCD display and a UART communication module to Node A.

Power Supply:  
-> Make sure all nodes are equipped with a stable power supply.

Step 2: Set Up CAN Communication  
Initialize CAN Transceivers:  
Configure the CAN transceivers for every node.  
Establish the CAN baud rate along with any other required settings.  
Develop CAN Protocol:  
Specify the structure of the CAN message.  
Create functionality in Node A for sending CAN messages.  
Create functionality in Nodes B, C, and D for receiving CAN messages.  

Step 3: Program Each Node 

Node A (Transmitter):  
-> Track the status of switches.  
-> Transmit the relevant CAN messages according to the status of the switches.  
-> Show status messages on the LCD as well as through UART.  

Node B (Right Indicator Receiver):  
-> Receive the CAN messages.  
-> Activate the right indicator LED based on the messages received.  

Node C (Left Indicator Receiver):  
-> Receive the CAN messages.  
-> Activate the left indicator LED based on the messages received.  

Node D (Wiper Receiver):  
-> Receive the CAN messages.  
-> Manage the wiper motor or servo according to the messages received.

Step 4: Testing and Debugging  

Evaluate Individual Nodes:  
-> Assess each node separately to confirm they function correctly.  

Examine Communication:  
-> Test the CAN communication among the nodes.  
-> Ensure that Node A successfully transmits messages and that Nodes B, C, and D accurately receive and respond to these messages.  

Troubleshoot Problems:  
-> Utilize debugging tools to detect and resolve any issues related to communication or control logic.  

Step 5: Final Integration  

Connect All Nodes:  
-> Link all nodes together through the CAN bus.  
-> Confirm proper communication and control across all nodes.  

Final Evaluation:  
-> Perform thorough testing to verify that the entire system operates as intended.  
-> Make any required modifications based on the test outcomes.

Conclusion:

This project effectively illustrates the application of the CAN protocol for node communication within an embedded system. The system can send and receive data frames, manage external devices, and offer feedback via UART and LCD interfaces. This implementation can be developed further for more intricate uses in automotive and industrial systems.
